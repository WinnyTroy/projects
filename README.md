# projects

A repo that holds all the personal projects covered during my tenure in Moringa.
3 in front end
1 in python(backend)
1 mobile development




The first thing to be viewed is the project name, link to the repo, project details(a project that deals with blah blah blah ), features, tools used, contributors.
